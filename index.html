            <h2>Why London?</h2>
            <h3>London is one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities</h3>
            <p>
              It is the largest metropolis in the United Kingdom, and it is also
              the country's economic, transportation, and cultural centre. In
              addition to its history, art, and politics, London is a popular
              tourist destination for its wide variety of museums, shops,
              restaurants, and sports teams.
            </p>
            <p>
              London is not just the capital of the UK, it is also the centre of
              its wealth, power and culture. London's influence is not only felt
              around the world – it is also very multicultural. 300 different
              languages are spoken there and anyone who loves the city can
              become a 'Londoner'. This is true no matter where they have come
              from – in the inner London boroughs, only 38% of the population
              has a white British background. Cultural influences from around
              the world help to make the city exciting and vibrant.
